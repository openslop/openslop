	exampleText: dedent`#Music: Soft welcoming ambient pad in C major, slow warm analog synth swells, distant felted piano notes spaced far apart, very low binaural pink noise underneath, no percussion, evokes the moment of pulling a duvet up to your chin. 50 BPM. Loopable for ~3 minutes.
		#Image: A cozy bedroom at night seen from shouldlow angle, soft amber lamplight on a nightstand, a book turned face-down on a folded quilt, a window with deep indigo sky and a sliver of moon, dreamy painterly style with soft brush textures, warm muted palette of cream, ochre, navy, and dusky rose, cinematic depth of field
		#Narration: Welcome to Get Sleepy, where we listen, we relax, and we get sleepy. My name is Thomas, and I'm your host.
		#Image: A long-limbed charcoal gray tabby cat with luminous honey-gold eyes sitting in profile on a windowsill at dusk, soft fur catching warm interior light, looking out toward a moonlit garden, painterly storybook illustration, gentle low contrast, dreamy and tender
		#Narration: Tonight, we return once more to the cozy world of cats and the quiet gardens they patrol. If you've enjoyed the adventures of Auggie, our fluffy black-and-white friend, you're in for another treat. Tonight we meet Marlowe, a long-limbed charcoal tabby with eyes the color of poured honey.
		#Image: A small stone cottage at the end of a quiet country lane at dusk, ivy on the walls, warm yellow light glowing in the kitchen window, a kettle's steam visible through the glass, an apple tree to the side, summer evening sky deepening from rose to indigo, painterly storybook style, peaceful and inviting
		#Narration: Marlowe lives in a stone cottage at the end of a quiet lane, with a family who keeps the kettle warm and the windows open all summer long. Tonight's story has been written for you by Alicia Stefan and read by Simon. It's called Marlowe's Midnight Wander.
		#Image: An overhead view of a person nestled into a bed under a thick patchwork quilt, soft pillow, a single bedside lamp casting a circle of honey light, peaceful expression, painterly soft-focus, the rest of the room fading into gentle darkness
		#Narration: So make yourself comfortable. Adjust your pillows. Smooth out your blankets. Let your shoulders soften down away from your ears, and let your jaw release. There is nothing else you need to do tonight, and nowhere else you need to be.
		#SFX: A single distant church bell ringing once, very soft, with a long natural reverb tail, layered under a barely audible breeze through summer leaves
		#Image: A deep indigo night sky scattered with soft glowing stars like grains of sugar on velvet, a slim crescent moon, silhouette of a single old plum tree in the foreground with leaves stirring gently, painterly dreamlike quality, atmospheric and peaceful
		#Narration: Closing your eyes, picture a sky the color of deep ink, scattered with stars like grains of sugar spilled across velvet. The air is soft and cool. Somewhere far off, a church bell rings the hour, low and unhurried. A breeze stirs the leaves of an old plum tree just beyond the window. This is where our story begins.

		#Music: Drowsy summer-night ambient bed in A minor, soft sustained string drones, occasional faint pizzicato cello notes like footsteps, distant cricket chirps woven into the texture, a low warm bass pulse barely felt, no melody, evokes lavender and moonlight, 45 BPM, loopable for ~5 minutes.
		#Image: A close-up of a charcoal gray tabby cat at a small wooden cat flap set in a cottage door, one paw raised, ears tilted forward and alert, soft amber kitchen light glowing behind him, painterly children's book illustration style, warm and intimate composition
		#Narration: Marlowe paused at the cat flap, one paw raised, ears tilted forward like little furled leaves. From inside the kitchen came the comforting hum of the dishwasher and the distant murmur of the radio. From outside came something far more interesting — a faint, layered medley of scent and sound that drifted in on the evening air.
		#SFX: The soft squeak and gentle plastic-on-wood click of a cat flap swinging once, then settling
		#Narration: He pushed his head through the flap, then his shoulders, then, with one elegant motion, the rest of himself. The garden welcomed him.
		#Image: A charcoal tabby cat standing on weathered flagstones in a moonlit cottage garden, lavender bushes glowing silvery in the moonlight on either side of the path, an old apple tree in the background, deep blue night sky with soft stars, painterly storybook style, dreamy and serene
		#Narration: He stood for a moment on the flagstones, letting his eyes adjust. The night was velvet-warm, the kind of summer evening that seemed to hold its breath. The lavender bushes that bordered the path stood drowsy and heavy with their last blooms of the season. They released their scent in slow waves, perfuming the air with something that was equal parts honey and herb.
		#SFX: A very soft, slow cat-breath inhale and exhale, faint and intimate
		#Narration: Marlowe inhaled deeply, his sleek gray sides expanding and contracting like a small bellows. He proceeded down the garden path with the unhurried gait of a country gentleman. Marlowe did not run. Marlowe did not hurry. Marlowe walked, and the world adjusted around him.
		#Image: A wider view of a quintessential English cottage garden at night, low stone wall along one edge with cushiony patches of pale lichen, gnarled apple tree in a corner, herb bed near a kitchen door, wild patch of foxgloves and cow parsley by a wooden gate, all under soft moonlight, painterly and romantic, deep greens and silvers and blues
		#Narration: The garden belonging to his humans was, in his considered opinion, a very fine establishment. There was the low stone wall along the western edge, perfectly sun-warmed in the daytime and now releasing that warmth back into the cool evening. There was the gnarled apple tree in the corner, its lower branches just the right height for resting. There was the herb bed near the kitchen door, the wilder patch of foxgloves and cow parsley near the gate, and — his very favorite — the long stone wall topped with soft cushions of lichen that ran the length of the back garden, ideal for promenading.
		#Image: A charcoal tabby cat captured mid-leap in graceful arc, jumping up onto a moonlit stone wall covered in pale lichen, tail extended for balance, fur slightly windblown, soft motion blur, painterly illustration style, sense of effortless elegance
		#SFX: The barely audible soft thump of cat paws landing on stone, followed by a tiny scrape of claws finding purchase
		#Narration: He made his way toward this wall now, leaping up onto it with the offhand grace of one who had done this a thousand times. From this vantage, he could survey both his own garden and the gardens of the two neighbors whose properties lay on either side.

		#Music: Slightly playful but still drowsy ambient piece in F major, low warm cello drone underneath, gentle clarinet or recorder phrases drifting in and out, a single soft glockenspiel note here and there for the comic dignity of the cat, distant owl hoot woven in once or twice, no rhythm section, evokes a wry observational night-watch, 50 BPM, loopable for ~5 minutes.
		#Image: A view from the top of a stone wall looking sideways into a neighboring garden full of climbing pink and white roses, with a small wooden chicken coop in the corner where three plump bantam hens are roosting peacefully, soft moonlight, painterly storybook style, abundant and idyllic
		#Narration: To the east lived Mrs. Pemberton, a kind elderly lady whose garden was a riot of climbing roses. She also kept three plump bantam hens, who were currently roosting in their little wooden coop and emitting the soft, contented clucks of birds who have eaten well and feel safe.
		#SFX: Three soft, low, sleepy hen clucks spaced out, very gentle, almost a contented murmur
		#Narration: The hens were no concern of Marlowe's. He had decided long ago that they were beneath his notice. They spent all day flustering about and pecking at the ground, and they had no conversation to speak of.
		#Image: A charcoal tabby cat sitting in serene perfect stillness on top of a fence, tail curled neatly around his white-socked paws, eyes half-closed in dignified disdain, while a huge russet-colored shaggy dog gazes up at him from the other side with sad baffled adoring eyes, painterly humor, soft moonlit palette
		#Narration: To the west lived a younger couple with a great shaggy dog named Beauregard. Beauregard was a russet-colored mountain of fur and friendliness, and he had spent much of his early career barking at Marlowe through the fence.
		#Narration: Marlowe had endured these efforts with serene indifference, sitting just out of reach with his tail curled neatly around his paws, blinking slowly, as if the noise were a faintly tedious weather report.
		#Narration: In time, Beauregard had given up. Now, when their paths crossed, the great dog simply gazed at Marlowe with sad, baffled eyes, and Marlowe — magnanimous in victory — would offer a single, gracious twitch of his tail in reply.
		#Image: A wide tranquil view of an empty cottage garden at night under a rising moon, no creatures stirring, lavender and foxgloves silvered with light, the stone wall stretching invitingly into the distance, a charcoal tabby cat small in the frame standing alone atop the wall, painterly atmospheric, peaceful and full of possibility
		#SFX: A very soft summer night ambience: faint distant crickets, a single far-off owl hoot, barely-there breeze through leaves
		#Narration: Tonight, Beauregard was nowhere to be seen. The garden was empty of dog, empty of human, empty of fuss. Marlowe began to walk the length of the wall.`,
